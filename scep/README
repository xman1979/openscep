This directory is supposed to contain a SCEP command line client.
However, this particular client doesn't do anything right now.

scep		a SCEP client implementation, does only one request at
		a time

scep_client	(missing) a full client implementation, handles polling
		until a certificate or a failure is returned

createkey	auxiliary script to create a private key

The scep program is capable of generating requests in three different
formats: classical SCEP request, version 2 request with PKCS#10 payload
and version 2 request with SPKAC payoad. The Makefile contains targets
to generate just such requests, and uses the following data:

test1	classical SCEP request, generated from test1.key and test1.req

	A suitable key and request can be created with the commands

	   openssl genrsa -out test1.key
	   openssl req -key test1.key -new -days 30 -out test1.req \
		-outform DER -config /usr/local/openscep/openscep.cnf

test2	version2 request, with scep client key test1.key and test client
	request test1.req (for the public key?), PKCS#10 payload
	test2.req

	   openssl genrsa -out test2.key
	   openssl req -key test2.key -new -days 30 -out test2.req \
		-outform DER -config /usr/local/openscep/penscep.cnf

test3	version2 request with scep client key test1.key and test client
	request test1.req, and SPKAC payload test3.spkc
