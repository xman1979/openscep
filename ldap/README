This directory contains supporting files for the LDAP Backend of the
OpenSCEP server.

openscep.schema	attribute type and object class definitions required for
		OpenSCEP

openscep.ldif	basic DIT used to store OpenSCEP information. Appart from
		the tree layout and the definition of the CA, this LDIF
		contains two predefined nodes, one with and one without a
		userPassword attribute. This is to show how automatic and
		manual SCEP clients work.

To set up an OpenLDAP 2.0.7 server for use with OpenSCEP, make sure the
main configuration file includes openscep.schema before starting the
server. Then add nodes described in openscep.ldif with any method you
like.

For development purposes, there is a sample slapd.conf file and some
supporting targets in the Makefile to help set up an LDAP directory with
all the correct data. Please read the Makefile.am for details.
