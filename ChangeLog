Release 0.4.1:
	* additional debugging in payload.c
	* spurious proxy authentication failure message in proxy.c remvoved

Release 0.4.0:
	* added test targets in the scep/Makefile so that testing the
	  various version 2 cases becomes simpler
	* added configure code to also detect the correct paths for the
	  openssl, ldapsearch and ldapmodify binaries
	* added file pending which contains all the functions needed to 
	  create pending requests read for the scepgrant script to sign
	* added file transcheck, which simplifies the checks for the state of
	  a transaction
	* modified the scepgrant script to be able to also grant certificates
	  for Netscape SPKAC requests
	* added an Object identifier for the ProxyAuthenticator attribute
	* made sure scepldap functions can work without a crash if no ldap
	  is available (must still ensure certificate can be found from the
	  file system in those cases)
	* added file proxy.c with function proxy_check for community
	  string verification in proxy requests
	* added the proxycommunity configuration variable to the scepd section
	* added two new request types 17: variable payload pkcsreq and
	  18 proxyrequest
	* rewrote {d2i,i2d}_PKCS7_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL_bio as macros as all
	  the other such functions in OpenSSL are
	* made configre detect the location of mv, and made sure the scripts
	  that grant or reject a request use the path thus found and don't
	  rely an mv being on the PATH (which happens not to be the case
	  for certain CGI environments)
	* fix some format errors in scepd.c
	* fix some warnings

Release 0.3.10:
	* fixed a documentation bug: download directory link was wrong, and
	  a disclaimer about binary packages needed to be added.

Release 0.3.9:
	* fixed some installation problems with file owner and group owner
	  (forgot to do it right in 0.3.8).

Release 0.3.8:
	* added info about mailinglist to the documentation
	* modified the logic to change the installation directory so that
	  it actually works :-(
	* make finger print checking optional (suggested by Udo Woehler), there
	  is a new configuration variable in openscep.cnf to handle this
	* make finger print comparision case insensitive (problem pointed
	  out by Ives Steglich)
	* Fix PATH in scepgrant, did not include /bin, which is essential
	  on Linux
	* Added a check for the altzone variable that must be set on solaris
	  to get correct timestamps.
	* Added patches by Peter Onion to make OpenSCEP interwork with the
	  UniCERT CA.

Release 0.3.7:
	* add the possibility in scep.c to write the request data to a
	  file for easier debugging
	* fix nested extern in sceplist.c:103, and some minor warnings
	  in cafingerprint.c
	* fix a missing include in init.c (pointed out by Peter Onion and
	  Ueli Rutishauser)
	* fix a byte order problem in http.c (pointed out by Ueli Rutishauser)
	* updated documentation to new version of the SCEP draft
	* beefed up derdump so that it is also capable of decoding PEM data

Release 0.3.6:
	* added document about revocation authorization
	* add a check in the revocation CGI program that checks for a user
	  name, and only accepts unauthenticated revocations from a list
	  of users
	* update the README for release 0.3.6
	* fix copyright on some dynamic pages

Release 0.3.5:
	* add cafinerprint to all scripts to include CA fingerprint as 
	  reminder on dynamic pages
	* add a cafingerprint program to enable display of CA key identifier
	  on dynamic pages, includes manual pages in nroff and HTML form
	* fix a HTML bug in title.html
	* added an option to sceplist to display the date in human
	  readable form instead of standard ASN1 format
	* incorrect link in welcome.html.in
	* Keep button did not belong to the same radio group, due to a 
	  missing $transid in the pending.pl script

Release 0.3.4:
	* the request script was essentially nonfunctional
	* pkiclient.exe script did not define scepconf -> core dump
	* add.pl had syntax error
	* request script for package installation had incorrect logic
	  causing an infinite loop
	* postinstall script should edit user and group in openscepsetup
	  script

Release 0.3.3:
	* modify the documentation to point out that the path to the
	  openssl binary must no be configured in the openscep binary
	* make the path to the openssl binary a configurable option
	  in the openscep configuration file
	* fix two typos in the request script for the package installation
	* fix the file scepxid.1.html missing from the Solaris package

Release 0.3.2:
	* allow the package installation to request the user/group of
	  the CA directories from the administrator installing the package
	* improved logging, fixed the log.pl CGI program to get the
	  location of the log file from the configuration file
	* scepd had insecure umask, bad for a CGI program
	* add information about the /var/tmp/openscep directory for
	  debugging, also added the directory to the Solaris package
	* make sure the openscep conf directory has the sticky bit set
	  in the package installation
	* fix a typo in the sunfreeware link in welcome.html.in
	* point out that the package is not usable on non UltraSPARC
	  systems, due to instruction set incompatiblities; problem
	  located in openssl libraries, not OpenSCEP. Will be better
	  as soon as OpenSSL can be built with shared libraries.

Release 0.3.1:
	* package install was not quite perfect: many files were missing
	  that are needed for a successful install
	* modified install of package to include openscep.cnf.dist
	  and openscepsetup to build a default configuration file from
	  the distribution
	* added manual pages for scepxid, createcrl, updatecrl
	* added package build for OpenSCEP. The package installs in
	  /usr/local, and assumes quite a few things about the location
	  of perl, openssl and the ldap libraries. If these packages 
	  were installed with defaults, there will be no problem.
	* renamed the casetup.sh script to openscepsetup, which makes
	  a name clash less likely, dito for transid -> sceptransid,
	  dn2transid -> dn2xid
	* added target attributes to external links on welcome page, fixed
	  some typos
	* add a link to the license on the welcome page

Release 0.3.0:
	* added the sceplist program, which can be used by CGI programs
	  create lists of granted or rejected certificates
	* added three new menu items to list granted, rejected and
	  revoked certificates
	* reverted certificate revokation to store the revoked certificates
	  in a revoked directory, because otherwise sceplist does not
	  know whether the item to read is a request or a certificate
	* make sure HTML directories are created before documentation
	  is installed there
	* include an LDIF to build the base nodes in the directory
	  in the distribution
	* make sure the pkiclient programm is installed in the configured
	  path, update documentation accordingly
	* let configure figure out the path to perl and include it in
	  the CGI programs

Release 0.2.2:
	* dn2transid was missing the string.h header

Release 0.2.1:
	* file scepclient.in was missing in the distribution
	* badreply.c contained a lot of obsolete code, now handled by
	  encode

Release 0.2:
	* first public release, do you really want to know what I did
	  to get to this point?
