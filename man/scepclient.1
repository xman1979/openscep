.TH SCEPCLIENT 1 "08/03/05" "OpenSCEP"
.SH NAME
scepclient \- request a certificate from a SCEP server, handle full protocol
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B scep 
[
.I options
] [
.I distinguished-name
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
While 
.BR scep (1)
only performs one request to a SCEP server and does not handle pending
replies by trying again,
.B scepclient
handles the full SCEP protocol.
It does so be repeating calls to
.BR scep (1)
until the certificate is granted, refused or a timeout
(too many retries) occurs.
The options needed to control the behavior of 
.B scepclient
are essentially identical to those of 
.BR scep .

.SH OPTIONS
(not quite correct yet)
.TP
.B \-d
increase the debug level by one (although this may not really be useful
in this particular case).
.TP
.BI \-c cacertificate
specifies 
.I cacertificate 
as the file containing the certificate of the certification
authority we want our request to sign.
.TP
.BI \-r request
specifies the file to contain the request. Note that the first
call to scep generates the request from the private key
specified with the
.B \-k
option and the distinguished name on the command line.
.TP
.BI \-k keyfile
The file 
.I keyfile
contains the private key of the user in PEM format.
.TP
.BI \-w challenge
specifies the challenge password to include in the options of the
generated request. Note that this is only necessary in the first
request, when the request file does not exist yet. Later requests
for the certificate do no longer need the challenge password.
.TP
.B \-p
directs 
.B scep
to poll the server for a the certificate. This is only needed if the first
request provokes a `pending' reply.
.TP
.BI \-u url
Defines the URL to contact for SCEP requests. This will normally be
something like

http://openscep.othello.ch/cgi-bin

Note that the SCEP specification fixes the name of the CGI-program to 
.I pkiclient.exe
which seems to be unnecessary restrictive.

.SH RETURN CODE
.B Scepclient
returns 0 if a certificate was retrieved, but 1 if not.
.SH VERSION
This page documents 
.B scepconf
as it appears in version 0.4.2 of OpenSCEP.
