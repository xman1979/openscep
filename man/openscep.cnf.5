.TH openscep.cnf 8 "08/03/05" "OpenSCEP"
.SH NAME
openscep.cnf \- OpenSCEP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B OpenSCEP
uses the configuration file mechanism provided
by OpenSSL for its own configuration.
All the
.B OpenSCEP
utilities read the configurationfile
.I /usr/local/lib/openscep/openscep.cnf
where various sections describe parameters foreign to OpenSSL
and only useful to
.BR OpenSCEP .
See the next sections for the
configuration parameters specific to
.BR OpenSCEP .

.SH SECTIONS
There are three main sections used by
.BR OpenSCEP .
The CA sections are more or less standard from OpenSSL.


.SH CA DEFINITIONS
See the OpenSSL documentation about details of the configuration
of a CA.

.SH SCEPD DEFINITIONS
These are the options the control the behaviour of the 
.BR scepd (8)
programm from the
.B OpenSCEP
distribution.
To keep the scripts that also use these variables simple, there are
no defaults for them. All of them must be set, which is especially
easy to do incorrectly when upgrading.

.TP
.BI "name = " CAname
Name of this CA, used to find the right CA section during CA operations.

.TP
.BI "cacert = "
Path to the PEM encoded CA certificate.

.TP
.BI "cakey = " /path/to/cakey.pem
Path to the PEM encoded and unencrypted CA key.

.TP
.BI "crl = " /path/to/crl.pem
Path to a PEM encoded certificate revokation list.

.TP
.BI "grantcmd = " /path/to/scepgrant
Path to the
.BR scepgrant (8)
program. 

.TP
.BI "automatic = " {true|false}
Specifies whether automatic enrollment is possible or not.

.TP
.BI "debug = " {true|false}
Specifies whether debug output should be generated.

.TP
.BI "logfile = " /path/to/logfile
Defines the log file. 
.BR syslog (8)
must be configured to direct log messages to this file.
This variable influences only the CGI-program used to display the
log file.

.TP
.BI "openssl = " /path/to/openssl/binary
Sets the fully qualified path to the 
.BR openssl (1)
binary. Note that on many installations, 
.BR openssl (1)
is not on the path, and there is no easy way for a CGI program
to find this program, hence the requirement that the path to it
must be configured.

.TP
.BI "crlusers = " users
This option allows to define a white space separated list of users 
(as authenticated by the web server) which are allowed to
perform certificate revocations without specifying the challenge
password from the request.

.TP
.BI "crlpublic = " {true|false}
If set to true, public access to certificate revocation is granted.
Any user who knows the challenge password of a certificate request
can revoke the corresponding certificate.
Note that trusted users as defined in the
.B crlusers
variable are not required to give the challenge password, even
if
.B crlpublic
is set to false.

.SH LDAP SECTION
In this section, all parameters needed to access the ldap directory
are defined. There are no defaults for these values, they must all
be set in the configuration file (this simplifies the code for the
CGI programs a little bit).

.TP
.BI "ldaphost = " ldapservername
Specifies the name of the LDAP server used as back end for the
certificate data.

.TP
.BI "ldapport = " ldapserverport
Specifies the TCP port number of the LDAP server used as back end for the
certificate data.

.TP
.BI "ldapbase = " basedn
The base distinguished name to be used by
.BR OpenSCEP .

.TP
.BI "binddn = " binddn
Some of the
.B OpenSCEP
programms need to update the directory, which
requires additional privileges.
They therefore use this distinguished name to bind to the directory,
and the password as specified by the 
.B bindpw
variable (see below).

.TP
.BI "bindpw = " bindpw
see 
.BR binddn .

.TP
.BI "ldapmodify = " /path/to/ldapmodify
Full path to the
.BR ldapmodify (1)
programm to be used to modify the directory. Note that a binary from
the OpenLDAP version 2 distribution must be used, as the CGI
scripts use some options only available in OpenLDAP.

.TP
.BI "ldapsearch = " /path/to/ldapsearch
program to be used to read the directory, only used in the crl revocation
program.

.SH SEE ALSO
The 
.B OpenSCEP
distribution comes with an example openscep.cnf file that one can use
as a starting point when setting up a CA.

.SH VERSION
This page documents
.B openscep.cnf
as it appears in version 0.4.2 of
.BR OpenSCEP .
