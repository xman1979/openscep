Probably many. In particular, some things are simply missing, consult
the TODO file for details.

- when a router is added which includes IP-address and serial number
  in the distinguished name, the CA should create the whole path of
  nodes in the LDAP directory. This is currently not done and the
  request will fail

- interoperability problem not sorted out yet with the uPKI toolkit

- reissuing a certificate with the same DN but a new private key does
  not work completely

- make install does not correctly install all the documentation
