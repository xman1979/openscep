Release 0.4.0 introduces two experimental extensions to the SCEP
protocol devised by Ueli Rutishauser and Alain Schaefer:

  1. SCEP can be used as a transport for requests other than PKCS#10,
     e.g. it is possible to carry a Netscape SPKI request within
     an PKCSReq message, but still retain the automatic enrollment
     capability.

  2. A SCEP client can work as a proxy for certificate requests. Such
     a proxy must of course be authenticated in some way, a community
     string is used for this purpose.

For the time being, the source code is the only documentation of this
extension. The authors have written a SCEP client library in Java and
a SCEP proxy that uses both features to distribute certificates to 
standard browsers. Their package will eventually be integrated in
OpenSCEP, and a paper detailing the protocol extension and its
implementation will appear shortly.
