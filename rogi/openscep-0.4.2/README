OpenSCEP is an open source implementation of the Simple Certificate
Enrollment Protocol SCEP used e.g. by Cisco routers to build a VPN
based on PKI technology.

What is SCEP?
=============

The protocol is documented in a recently expired internet draft
which for the convenience of the reader has been include in the
distribution in the doc directory. It basically works by sending a
PKCS#7 encrypted and signed certificate request to a CGI program
on an HTTP server, which then either returns a certificate, denies
it or puts it in a queue of pending requests. In the latter case
the client will poll the server until it either times out or receives
a certificate or is denied a certificate.

It is also possible to automatically issue a certificate if the
requesting user can be authenticated in an LDAP directory. The
protocol protects the password used to authenticate the user by
encrypting the certificate request. OpenSCEP will store the certificate
of the user automatically in the directory in this case.

Installation
============

This package is configured and built using the normal configure;
make; make install cycle you may be familiar with. However, to build
successfully, the following prerequisite packages need to be installed:

  - openssl-2.0.7, note that other versions will work also, but are not
    currently supported. In particular the schema extensions needed for
    automatic enrollment are only documented in the form needed by
    openldap 2. Other LDAP servers may work as well, but have not
    been tested.

  - openssl-0.9.6, note that a patch should be applied if you wish
    crl distribution points to work (this patch is from openosp, and
    the status is not quite clear). The patch can be found in the openssl
    subdirectory of the distribution.

  - Apache, probably almost any version will do. Other servers have not
    been tested, but any server able to run CGI programs should do.

  - Perl must be installed on the system. No special modules are required
    though.

For Solaris, there is a binary package available. However, this package
was built with default settings on an UltraSPARC system, so the OpenSSL
libraries require the SPARC V8+ instruction set. They will not work on
systems only supporting the plain V8 instruction set, like the web server
openscep.othello.ch.

Configuration
=============

Setting up OpenSCEP is described in detail in the file SETUP in the
top level distribution directory.
